Machine learning engineer nanodegree Capstone_Project

Author: Musa Mikail

##Summary##
This repository documents my final capstone project  submitted to udacity for the completion of the machine learning engineer nanodegree that I completed on 30th June 2019.

##Objective:##
Develop and deploy a malaria diagnostic system based on a convolution neural network model.

Tool and libraries:
- Language: python 3.7
- Image processing: OpenCV
- GUI: pyQt
- Machine learning modelling: tensorflow/pytorch
- Visualization: pyplot.matplotlib
- Integration/ version control: github
- base model: VGGNet-Simonyan et al: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf?source=post_page
OpenCV algorithm for edge detection: Canny Edge Detector: https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/imgproc/imgtrans/canny_detector/canny_detector.html

##Dataset##
Malaria Dataset: https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/
